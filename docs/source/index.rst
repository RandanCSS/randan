randan documentation
==================================

Overview
==================
``randan`` is a python package that aims to provide most of the functions presented in SPSS. Unlike the other python packages for data analysis, it has three main features, which make it attractive for social scientists:

1. it provides the results of the analysis in a readable and understandable form, similar to SPSS
2. it gives you information about statistical significance of the parameters whenever possible
3. it unites all the necessary methods so you do not need to switch between different packages and software anymore

``randan`` should be used in Jupyter Notebook and your data should be stored in ``pandas`` DataFrames.

This documentation aims to provide information about how ``randan``'s classes are organized.
For examples of usage and detailed tutorials, go to `Github page <https://github.com/LanaLob/randan>`_ of this project.
